Released end of November 2018.\n\nMade a Free version and a Paid version, nearly making 2+ sales a day, without any marketing.\n\nThe Application helps a niche, where there is problems with Reddit's Video Media files, that do not download and share properly on Mobile.\n\nThe App can also download other media types like Gifs, Streamables, Gyfcat, Giphy just to name a few, where ever user desires.\n\nThe media can then easily be shared and VIEWed later as videos.",
